# TechnologyFruit Microservices Gateway Service

Welcome to the TechnologyFruit Microservices Gateway Service repository! This repository contains the code for a gateway service that manages and routes requests to various microservices within the TechnologyFruit ecosystem.

## Overview

The gateway service acts as an entry point for clients to interact with different microservices seamlessly. It provides a unified interface and handles routing requests to appropriate microservices based on predefined rules or configurations.

## Features

- **Request Routing**: The gateway service routes incoming requests to corresponding microservices based on predefined routes or rules.
- **Load Balancing**: It distributes incoming requests among multiple instances of microservices to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization.
- **Authentication and Authorization**: It may handle authentication and authorization for incoming requests before forwarding them to microservices.
- **Logging and Monitoring**: The gateway service may include logging and monitoring functionalities to track request/response data and service health.

# Microservice CI/CD Pipeline

This pipeline automates the deployment process of a microservice on an AWS EKS cluster. It includes stages for Git checkout, Maven build, SonarQube static code analysis, AWS ECR image build and push, EKS cluster connection, and deployment on the EKS cluster.

## Prerequisites

- Jenkins with necessary plugins installed.
- AWS IAM user with appropriate permissions for ECR, EKS, and necessary resources.
- SonarQube server with projects set up for static code analysis.
- Maven configured on the Jenkins server.
- Terraform installed on the Jenkins server if using Terraform for EKS cluster creation (currently commented out).

## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is configured using a Jenkinsfile. It includes parameters for:
- `action`: Choose between `create` or `delete` to create or destroy resources.
- `aws_account_id`: AWS Account ID where resources will be deployed.
- `Region`: AWS region where resources will be deployed.
- `ECR_REPO_NAME`: Name of the ECR repository.
- `cluster`: Name of the target EKS cluster.

## Pipeline Overview

The pipeline is defined using Jenkins declarative pipeline syntax. It consists of several stages, each responsible for a specific part of the deployment process:

1. **Git Checkout**: Checks out the code from the Git repository.

2. **Unit Test Maven**: Runs unit tests using Maven.

3. **Integration Test Maven**: Runs integration tests using Maven.

4. **Static Code Analysis: Sonarqube**: Analyzes the code for quality using SonarQube.

5. **Quality Gate Status Check: Sonarqube**: Checks the quality gate status in SonarQube.

6. **Maven Build: Maven**: Builds the project using Maven.

7. **AWS Image Build: ECR**: Builds Docker images and stores them in Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).

8. **AWS Image Scan: Trivy**: Scans Docker images for vulnerabilities using Trivy.

9. **AWS Image Push: ECR**: Pushes Docker images to Amazon ECR.

10. **AWS Image Cleanup: ECR**: Cleans up old Docker images from Amazon ECR.

11. **Connect to EKS**: Configures access to the AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) cluster.

12. **Deployment on EKS Cluster**: Deploys the application on the AWS EKS cluster using Kubernetes (kubectl).


## Pipeline Configuration

The pipeline is defined using Jenkins pipeline syntax. You can customize it by modifying the `Jenkinsfile-AWS-Pipeline` in this repository. Adjust the stages, parameters, and steps as needed to fit your project requirements.
